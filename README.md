## Milestone 1 Feedback
Your documentation needs more detail here, and a more clear direction. The Persona and Use Case are incomplete because they lack sufficient detail to guide your design phase going forward, and I'm unclear regarding the direction and purpose of the use case.  

The following questions may help: 
- What kind of employers or jobs are you looking to apply to?
- What kind of employer will be looking at your website? 
- What skills would you like to highlight?  
- How can the above questions guide your design choices?

It's OK if you don't have a clear idea yet, or if you decide to change your direction later on, but let's see if you can put together something more clear before your design phase in Milestone 2. There are also errors in your HTML. See Edits &amp; Suggestions below.

As it is, your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier I](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). Do some additional work on this by Monday 10/24/16, and I'll bump your grade up to Tier II. What I'm looking for here is the kind of detail that you would give to an employer or a client at the Jr. Web Developer or Web Dev Intern level.

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Your HTML &lt;head&gt; tag is missing some required elements: the **meta charset** tag and the **title** tag.
- Fix typo in "documetation"
- Don't forget the `lang="en"` attribute on your &lt;html&gt; tag.
- Have a look at the [Sample PWP Milestones](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/example/) for guidance on creating a Persona and Use Case
