## Milestone 1 Feedback
Your documentation needs more detail here, and a more clear direction. The Persona and Use Case are incomplete because they lack sufficient detail to guide your design phase going forward, and I'm unclear regarding the direction and purpose of the use case.  

The following questions may help: 
- What kind of employers or jobs are you looking to apply to?
- What kind of employer will be looking at your website? 
- What skills would you like to highlight?  
- How can the above questions guide your design choices?

It's OK if you don't have a clear idea yet, or if you decide to change your direction later on, but let's see if you can put together something more clear before your design phase in Milestone 2. There are also errors in your HTML. See Edits &amp; Suggestions below.

As it is, your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier I](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). Do some additional work on this by Monday 10/24/16, and I'll bump your grade up to Tier II. What I'm looking for here is the kind of detail that you would give to an employer or a client at the Jr. Web Developer or Web Dev Intern level.

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Your HTML &lt;head&gt; tag is missing some required elements: the **meta charset** tag and the **title** tag.
- Fix typo in "documetation"
- Don't forget the `lang="en"` attribute on your &lt;html&gt; tag.
- Have a look at the [Sample PWP Milestones](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/example/) for guidance on creating a Persona and Use Case

## Milestone 2&alpha; Feedback
First thing, the CSS in your `<img>` tags is skewing the images. I had to use DevTools to see your images properly. CSS inside HTML tags is a bigtime NOPE. D: 

Without a Content Strategy, I do not have enough information here in the wireframes to decipher your plans for your site. For example, I don't know what content or links are supposed to go in the header and navbar. What we are looking for here in your Milestone 2a documentation is a level of detail and clarity that you might submit to your boss or client.

I also don't see a contact form here. Remember that a contact form is a required component of your site.

Unfortunately, I cannot sign off on this Milestone until the Content Strategy section is complete. Please review the [Milestone 2&alpha; Documentation](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-two/) and [Sample Milestones](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/example/)

Please be aware that a missing or [Tier 0](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/) Milestone can fail your PWP. See Edits &amp; Suggestions below for details, and please finish up your Content Strategy ASAP and resubmit.

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Please complete your Content Strategy section and re-submit this Milestone ASAP in order to recieve sign-off to begin development.
- Your HTML indentation is off, and your `<head>` tag is missing the required elements! Please fix.
- NO CSS in your HTML tags please! Size your images in a CSS file, and remove the inline CSS please.
- Your images are missing the required `alt` text.

## Milestone 2a Feedback - Update
Hey Nathan - just took a look at your Content Strategy update to Milestone 2a. Can you bring this up a notch? The more detailed your plan is, the easier your development will go. And it's important that you are able to clearly communicate your strategy as a developer. I'm looking for something that you would write for someone you're doing professional work for.

Have a look at the Sample PWP Milestones here for help: 
https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/example/

I'm going to give you the go ahead to keep working on your PWP. At the present time, I can only pass this Milestone at [Tier I](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). Keep in communication with the bridge as you move forward with this project. We're here to help. We'll be checking up with you too.
