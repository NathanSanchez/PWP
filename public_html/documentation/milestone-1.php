Hank is always the first to show up at social events. Hank is knowen by is family as a very nice man who would do almost anything for his family, by his employees Hank is known as very hard Hank wants you to work as hard as he does if he catches you slacking he will chew you out.  </li>

			<li>Frustrations and Needs: Hank already has a website but its a couple of years old and it needs up some dates, so hank contracted another developer who long story short took most of the budget leaving hank little money to work with. Hanks needs are to find a developer who will work for not too much money and do the work that hank expects. Hank is worried that he is going to lose more of his online buyers.</li>

			<li>Goals: Hanks goals are to find somebody who works hard like he does but will do it for less. Hanks other goal is to be one of the top search results in google so he can get more of the online market to his business so his company can keep expanding at the rate he would like.</li>

		<h1>Use Case</h1>

		<p>So i Nathan Sanchez got recommenced the job by one of my friends who saw the posting on cragslist after he had contacted Hank to inquire about the job offering realized that Hank was paying too low and sent me the cragslist link. I read the posting and decide ill send him my git and my resume and my website since i don't have a full time job yet. Hank gets the email goes through my resume and isnt super impressed but he decides to take a look at my website and sees that its way better then he expected. Hank takes the day to think about my offer he then decides that he will give me a call so he can get the ball rolling on this project of his. Hank gives me a call at 5pm to tell me that i have the job.</p>
