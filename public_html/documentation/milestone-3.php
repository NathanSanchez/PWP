				My Name is Nathan Andrew Sanchez, I was born and raised in Albuquerque New Mexico.
				Computers and video games have always been a huge part of my life from playings thousands of hours of video games
				to building my own gaming pc. Computers and any kind of new tech excites me. The idea of being on the cutting edge of a new technologies is
				really cool to me. One of my other grate passions in life is cars/motorcycles riding a motorcycle there's really nothing quite like it having the air
				rushing around you as your shifting through the gears is a amazing feeling what i imagine is the closest thing to flying. Cars on the other hand not only do you get that amazing feeling of being put in the back of your seat
				as you hit the gas, there's a huge style thing cars aren't just about speed there about style to being able to add you own style to a car is
				what makes the car yours. About my background i was raised in a family of 5 as the youngest of 3, during high school i was homeschooled after high school
				i went to deep dive coding bootcamp, a 40+ hour a week full stack web development class where i learned HTML5, JavaScript, Angular 2, MySQL, PHP and PHPUnit, CSS3, Bootstrap, GitHub, jQuery.
				But i continue to learn and keep getting better and better. im hoping to be starting my career as a Web Developer in 2017 Coding is alot of fun but also has some big challengs
				which i anticipate and am ready for.

						For my Experience as a employee ive Had two jobs that ive done in the past. One of the jobs was working at dominos as a pizza maker / taker of phones.
						it was at this job that i first leared about working as it was my first job that i got shortly after turing 16, working there was harder the expected but it
						taught me alot of lessons such as working with a team and working under a suprising amount of stress. My seconed job that i got was working at hinkle family fun center
						which is a family fun center so it has arcade games, lazertag, paintball, go karts, and all kinds of other fun stuff. I started there as a tranee then moved up to fun expert about
						a year afteri started working there i got promoted to Team Leader where my job was to lead the Team in day to day task such as opening up, closing and dealing with
						 frustrated customers. It was at this job where i leared the vaule of good customer service and how not only be on a team but also lead it.
						for my Experience as a Web Dev as i mentioned above i went to deep dive coding bootcamp which is a full stack web development class where i learned
						HTML5, JavaScript, Angular 2, MySQL, PHP and PHPUnit, CSS3, Bootstrap, GitHub, jQuery. In this class we get set in to groups where we begain development of a
						web app of our choice called capstone. My capstone is called Cannaduceus its main perpose is to help medical marijuana patients find dispensarys near them and to help find the
						right strain of marijuana for them. its actually pretty cool theres a lot of code that goes in to it such as a little bit of html5 a whole lot of php and of coures Css and Anglur abd a couple more.
						Last but not least this here website!
