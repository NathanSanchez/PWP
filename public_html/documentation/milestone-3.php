				My Name is Nathan Andrew Sanchez, I was born and raised in Albuquerque New Mexico.
				Computers and video games have always been a huge part of my life from playings thousands of hours of video games
				to building my own gaming pc. Computers and any kind of new tech excites me. The idea of being on the cutting edge of a new technologies is
				really cool to me. One of my other grate passions in life is cars/motorcycles riding a motorcycle there's really nothing quite like it having the air
				rushing around you as your shifting through the gears is a amazing feeling what i imagine is the closest thing to flying. Cars on the other hand not only do you get that amazing feeling of being put in the back of your seat
				as you hit the gas, there's a huge style thing cars aren't just about speed there about style to being able to add you own style to a car is
				what makes the car yours. About my background i was raised in a family of 5 as the youngest of 3, during high school i was homeschooled after high school
				i went to deep dive coding bootcamp, a 40+ hour a week full stack web development class where i learned HTML5, JavaScript, Angular 2, MySQL, PHP and PHPUnit, CSS3, Bootstrap, GitHub, jQuery.
				But i continue to learn and keep getting better and better. im hoping to be starting my career as a Web Developer in 2017 Coding is alot of fun but also has some big challengs
				which i anticipate and am ready for.
