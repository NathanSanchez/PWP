		<p>my plan is to really get this site looking good right now im thinking about grey or green (possibly both)
			i think it would be cool to show some of my code in the site. I want to have a hot bar at the top with 3 or 4 other pages that will go to my best code more info and maybe another with me talking about code like technical stuff like problems ive had before and how i solved them or something similar.</p>
